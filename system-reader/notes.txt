put license for dll files in git


Concurrency:
one task could update hardware 1, then before got answer, another task could ask to update hardware 1 too.
 Have it blocking?
 Add status "updating" and send back when status changed?

check if possible that calls to update() are sent faster than receiving and it fills the queue. Make sure only one at a time in task (I think already the case because of "await"


self.datas should be an array per client, right now it's sending to anyone connected, needs to be "per client"


RENDU:
# TODO change requested_sensors from List to dictionary
# TODO Client button (and "action": "stop_data") to stop sending hardware updates
# TODO List requested_sensors needed for laptop testing
# TODO List requested_sensors for Desktop testing
# TODO Change fetch_stats to reflect Dictionary instead of List
# TODO Create interface with graphs and how I want it to look
# TODO Client update UI with each data coming up


If getting error "cannot build assembly", it's because the dll is locked:
1-Right-click on the .dll
2-"Properties"
3-Under "General", click "Unblock"
