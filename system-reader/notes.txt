put license for dll files in git


Concurrency:
one task could update hardware 1, then before got answer, another task could ask to update hardware 1 too.
 Have it blocking?
 Add status "updating" and send back when status changed?

check if possible that calls to update() are sent faster than receiving and it fills the queue. Make sure only one at a time in task (I think already the case because of "await"


self.datas should be an array per client, right now it's sending to anyone connected, needs to be "per client"


RENDU:
# TODO Find out why  “Only one usage of each socket address is normally permitted” sometimes
# TODO List requested_sensors for Desktop testing
# TODO Create interface with graphs and how I want it to look
# TODO Logging! (See category below)
# TODO Clear all the console output and add useful info/debug/errors in logging
# TODO Client button (and "action": "stop_data") to stop sending hardware updates
# TODO List requested_sensors needed for laptop testing
# TODO Client update UI with each data coming up

LOGGING:
# TODO Proper logging method or class (Need level:info-debug-error) and tag, like Android. Would be hardware-task-thread-communication-...
# TODO RotatingFileHandler?
# TODO Add Date, level, name
# TODO Add logging for info and errors, so that if program crashes (socket in use for example), I know about it
# TODO Have a flag or something to display in console as well as file if flag is set to debug, with colors per tag (yellow = hardware, thread=blue, etc...)


If getting error "cannot build assembly", it's because the dll is locked:
1-Right-click on the .dll
2-"Properties"
3-Under "General", click "Unblock"
